# authorship
Vibe coded scripts to manage and create authorship lists. Any bugs are Gemini's fault.

Run tidy_authorship.py with a given document file containing a list of authors and affiliations
formatted like that in hprc_r2/authorship.docx. Will ensure affiliations are ordered according to where they appear in the author list.

The component scripts can be used to convert an author doc to CSV files (and back again), as well
as reordering the affiliations.
